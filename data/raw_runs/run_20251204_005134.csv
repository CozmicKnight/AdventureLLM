Conquering his fears, the troll puts you to death.
It appears that that last blow was too much for you. I'm afraid you are dead.

   ****  You have died  ****

Now, let's take a look here... Well, you probably deserve another chance. I
can't quite fix you up completely, but you can't have everything.

Canyon View
You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its west wall. From here there is a
marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River upstream. Across the
canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs join the mighty ramparts of the Flathead
Mountains to the east. Following the Canyon upstream to the north, Aragain Falls
may be seen, complete with rainbow. The mighty Frigid River flows out from a
great dark cavern. To the west and south can be seen an immense forest,
stretching for miles around. A path leads northwest. It is possible to climb
down into the canyon from here.
There is a sword here.

more cliff, which appears climbable.

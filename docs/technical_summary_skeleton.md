# Technical Summary (Skeleton)

## Introduction
Briefly describe the motivation: benchmarking LLM agents on Zork I via a modular
pipeline.

## Methods / System Architecture
Placeholder for diagram showing: ZorkAPI → API Adapter → Game Manager → Prompt
Builder → LLM Runner → Logging → Analysis.

## Models & Experimental Setup
List models, max moves, prompt template, and connection details (ZorkAPI URL,
OpenAI key management).

## Metrics & Results
Summaries of score progression, moves to termination, token usage. Include plots
from `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`.

## Limitations & Ethical Considerations
Notes on reliance on proprietary APIs, deterministic mock vs. real gameplay, and
any potential misuse considerations.

## Future Work
Ideas for improved memory, additional models, richer analytics, or support for
Zork II/III.
